To install this simple script, do the following:

1. Run init.sh with `./init.sh` or `sh init.sh` to initialize the
   program.
3. Run splan.sh

Optionally, you may want to symlink splan.sh to somewhere in the PATH,
or move it there, or maybe even add the drectory where it is to you
PATH.
Just do whatever you find convenient.

Good luck with the program; have fun using it.
