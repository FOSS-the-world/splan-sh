To install this simple script, do the following:

1. Run install.sh and hope it works.
2. If you chose a directory that isn't in the PATH, include it now.
3. Run splan

Optionally, you may want to symlink splan.sh to somewhere in the PATH,
or move it there, or maybe even add the drectory where it is to you
PATH.
Just do whatever you find convenient.

Good luck with the program; have fun using it.
